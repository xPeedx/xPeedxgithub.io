# MyWebsite


My name is Peed. I was born on planet Earth in 1981.
Since then, I grew up, went to school, went to university,
and worked in this strange system called capitalism for 16 years.

Now I decided to break out and see the world, the real lifeâ€¦
I bought a "new" camper to travel around and see the world.
